- Simple and Reliable: Easy to set up and use.

## Components
- LEDS
- Transistors
- Resistors
- Wires
- Switch
- power supply

## Instructions
- Connect the Components: Assemble the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
- Power the Circuit: Connect the power supply to the circuit.
- Read the Levels: The LEDs will light up according to the water level detected by the sensor.
## Usage
- Ensure the sensor is properly placed in the water tank.
- Turn on the power supply.
- Observe the LEDs to determine the water level.
## Troubleshooting
- If the LEDs do not light up, check all connections and ensure the power supply is working.
- Make sure the water level sensor is functioning correctly and placed at the correct depth in the tank.
